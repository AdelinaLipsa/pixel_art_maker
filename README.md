## 3rd Party Libraries

I use the following 3rd party libraries in my project: 

| Name | Reason | What it does |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| [html2canvas](https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas) | to take "screenshots" of webpages or parts of it, directly on the users browser| renders the current page as a canvas image, by reading the DOM and the different styles applied to the elements
    
## Implementation

| Q | A |
| --- | --- |
| Why did you choose this technology (s) / language (s) | I started my journey in Front End with Javascript and at the moment is the only language I have worked with. I believe that JS will keep its place in top tier programming languages as browsers are becoming more and more complex. |
| How confident are you in dealing with the selected language (s) / technology (s) | Given the fact that it has been the only language I worked with, I kept playing with it until it was fun for me to write something new, a new app or a new website.  |
| Why did you choose a particular framework | I chose Jquery for this project for its readability and simplicity |
